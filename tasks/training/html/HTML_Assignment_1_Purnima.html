If you put extra/consecutive white spaces or newlines in the code it will regard it as one white space this is known as collapsing of white spaces. In this article, we will discuss the advantages of collapsing white space in HTML.

    Advantages of collapsing white spaces :
    
    While you are writing the HTML for your web page you want the code to be more understandable/readable to the users.
