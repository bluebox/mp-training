The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to
give parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows
and films in their own space.

Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls that let
you restrict the maturity rating of content kids can watch and
block specific titles you don’t want kids to see.
