The old clockmaker, Silas, sat hunched over his workbench, the only light filtering through the dusty window illuminating his wrinkled hands. He wasn't repairing a watch today, but a grandfather clock. It was a beautiful, mahogany beast, its face a canvas of faded gold. Silas had built this clock for his wife, Eleanor, years ago, a promise whispered in the ticking of its pendulum.
The clock had been silent for decades, ever since Eleanor's passing. Silas, a man of few words, held onto its silence as if it were a tangible piece of her memory. He worked slowly, carefully, his fingers remembering the grooves of the gears, the subtle contours of the springs. 
Finally, with a soft click, the pendulum swung back and forth, a steady rhythm filling the quiet room. Silas watched, his eyes filled with a tear he hadn't felt in years. He wasn't just hearing the tick-tock of a clock; he was hearing Eleanor's heartbeat again
